					<h2>International Mother Language Day </h2>
					<p>21 February is now observed all over the world as a red letter day. In our country it is observed as a national mourning day. The national flag is hoisted half mast to mark the day. People of all classes bring out a procession called “probhat fery”. Everybody in the procession walks bare-footed and sings the song. “Aner bhaer rakte rangano 21 February amiki bhulite pari”. Flowers and wreathes are placed at the foot of the shaded minar to pay homage to the martyrs. Discussions, seminars and cultural shows are organized throughout the country. Our newspapers bring out special features. The TV & Radio put up special programmers highlighting the significance of the day. </p>
